# 🐴 Knight's Tour Visualization

## 📖 Project Overview

This project visualizes the **Knight’s Tour** problem on a chessboard using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It animates the knight's moves across the board, showing the knight's path as it visits every square exactly once.

The Knight's Tour is a classic chess and algorithm problem that demonstrates backtracking and Warnsdorff's heuristic.
